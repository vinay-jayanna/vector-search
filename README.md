# Vector Search at Scale: Pinecone, FAISS, and Elasticsearch Deep Dive  

## Overview  
Vector search is the backbone of **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)**, AI-powered recommendations, and multimodal search.  
This repository explores **how large-scale AI systems retrieve billions of high-dimensional vectors efficiently**, leveraging:  

âœ… **Pinecone** â€“ Fully managed, scalable vector search  
âœ… **FAISS** â€“ GPU-optimized high-performance ANN search  
âœ… **Elasticsearch** â€“ Hybrid keyword + vector search  

## Topics Covered  
- **HNSW, IVF-PQ, and quantization techniques**  
- **Scaling ANN search to billions of vectors**  
- **Sharding, distributed execution, and query routing**  
- **Performance trade-offs: speed vs. memory vs. accuracy**  
- **Real-world AI applications using vector databases**  

## Code Examples  
This repo includes **fully working examples** for:  
- **Pinecone: Scalable billion-scale vector search with metadata filtering**  
- **FAISS: GPU-accelerated ANN search with IVF-PQ indexing**  
- **Elasticsearch: Hybrid BM25 + dense vector search for enterprise AI**
